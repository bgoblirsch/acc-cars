  Assetto Corsa Competizione Car Specifications
</h1>

Since there is no car information in-game, and I could not find a collection of car specs anywhere online (for ACC or GT3 in general), I decided to gather the info myself and make my own site!
The website is built using [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com). Adding new cars is as simple as creating a new markdown file in /src/cars and adding a corresponding image.
