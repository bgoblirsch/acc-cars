  Assetto Corsa Competizione Car Specifications

Since there is no car information in-game, and I could not find a collection of car specs anywhere online (for ACC or GT3 in general), I decided to gather the info myself and make my own site!

The website is a work in progress and was built using [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com). Adding new cars is as simple as creating a new markdown file in /src/cars and adding a corresponding image.

I am awaiting a response from Kunos Simulazioni for permission to use the images from the official Assetto Corsa Competizione Website.
